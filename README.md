# Hooligan Fights

First person shooter. The game was developed in Unity3D.

The player controls the hooligan of team W. There are opponents on the map - hooligans of the opposing team (C). For killing an opponent the player gets the points (killing with a machete or hands generates additional ammo). The winner is the person who in the given time reaches the most points and will be entered in the winner's table. The real soundtracks have been used in the game. They were taken from the stadium.

### Weapons

There are several types of weapons:
* fists (can block enemy attack)
* machete
* revolver
* rifle
